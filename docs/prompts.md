First Jules Run Review planning-center-sdk. This folder and sub folders has a large amount of documentation, proposed objects, JSON files, it details out the PlanningCenter Api including all the calls and objects that are used.  Please review all the documentation and break down how we would implement this Api which includes interfaces, models, services, helpers, global exception system in the current .net 9 projects structure which includes a client, models, abstraction and test projects. The solution also includes what will be come three example projects in the /examples folder that are two .net core console and one worker. Put all the things you learn in the /docs/plans folder. Break down the phases and steps you believe we need to do to accomplish this. Save all prompts you get from me with the date and time in /docs/prompts.md.
