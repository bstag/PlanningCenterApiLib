# Planning Center .NET SDK - Strategic Development Documents

This directory contains key strategic documents that outline the analysis, implementation strategy, and phased development plan for the Planning Center .NET SDK. These documents are intended to guide the design and construction of the SDK.

## Documents

1.  **`PlanningCenter_SDK_Analysis.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a detailed analysis of the existing assets related to the Planning Center API. This includes a review of the initial SDK blueprint, the structure and content of the API data (JSON schemas), existing C# object definitions, and supplementary markdown documentation.
    *   **Key Contents:** Findings on API structure, data model variations across modules, current state of object models, and identification of key challenges and considerations for SDK development.

2.  **`SDK_Implementation_Strategy.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Outlines the comprehensive strategy for implementing the .NET SDK. It details the architectural decisions, project structure, approaches for model definition, API interaction styles, and other critical development aspects.
    *   **Key Contents:** Overall architecture, detailed breakdown of each project (Models, Abstractions, Client, Tests, Examples), model generation and unification approach, service and fluent API implementation strategies, authentication and error handling plans, resilience mechanisms, and the SDK's own code documentation strategy.

3.  **`SDK_Development_Phases.md`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Describes a phased, iterative approach for the actual development of the SDK. This document breaks down the implementation process into manageable stages, serving as a roadmap.
    *   **Key Contents:** Detailed steps for each development phase, from initial project setup and core infrastructure implementation to module-by-module feature development, testing, documentation, and finalization.

## How to Use These Documents

*   Start with **`PlanningCenter_SDK_Analysis.md`** to understand the context and existing materials from which the SDK plan is derived.
*   Refer to **`SDK_Implementation_Strategy.md`** for a deep dive into *how* the SDK will be built, including its structure and the design principles for its various components.
*   Use **`SDK_Development_Phases.md`** as a guide for the sequence of development activities if and when the SDK implementation commences.

These documents collectively provide a comprehensive plan for building a robust, modern, and developer-friendly .NET SDK for the Planning Center API.
