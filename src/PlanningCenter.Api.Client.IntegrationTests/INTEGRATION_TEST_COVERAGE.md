## Next Steps - Phase 3 Modules Ready for Testing

1. **Additional Service Tests** - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
   - **ServicesService Integration Tests** - Test Plans, Items, Songs, Service Types (19 methods)
   - **GroupsService Integration Tests** - Test Groups, Group Types, Memberships (15 methods)
   - **CheckInsService Integration Tests** - Test Check-Ins and Events (12 methods)
   - **CalendarService Integration Tests** - Test Events and Resources (15 methods)
   - Consider testing service-specific features and edge cases

2. **Authentication Tests**
   - Test both Personal Access Token and OAuth authentication methods
   - Test token refresh and expiration scenarios

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Test large data set handling
   - Test pagination performance
   - Test concurrent request handling

4. **Error Recovery Tests**
   - Test retry logic for transient errors
   - Test timeout handling
   - Test network interruption scenarios

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Configure integration tests to run in CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up secure credential management for CI/CD

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Test Data Management**
   - Always clean up test data after tests
   - Use inactive status for test records
   - Use random data to avoid conflicts

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Keep sensitive credentials out of source control
   - Document configuration requirements

3. **Test Organization**
   - Group tests by service and functionality
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

4. **Assertions**
   - Use FluentAssertions for readable assertions
   - Assert both positive and negative cases
   - Verify all relevant properties and behaviors
