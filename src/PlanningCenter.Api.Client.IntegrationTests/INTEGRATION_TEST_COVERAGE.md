# Integration Test Coverage Summary

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the integration test coverage for the PlanningCenter.Api.Client library and outlines next steps for further improvements.

## Current Test Coverage

### PeopleService Tests

1. **Basic CRUD Operations**
   - Get current user (GetMe)
   - Create, retrieve, update, and delete people
   - List people with pagination
   - Get all people (automatic pagination)
   - Stream people (async enumerable)

2. **Contact Information Management**
   - Address management (add, update, delete)
   - Email management (add, update, delete)
   - Phone number management (add, update, delete)

3. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - Non-existent resources
   - Validation errors
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid data formats
   - Concurrent operations

### ApiConnection Tests

1. **Core HTTP Functionality**
   - GET requests
   - Paged GET requests
   - DELETE requests
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting

## Test Infrastructure

1. **Configuration**
   - appsettings.json for default configuration
   - appsettings.local.json for local credentials (gitignored)
   - Environment variable support

2. **Test Fixtures**
   - TestFixture for shared service provider
   - TestCollection for xUnit collection fixture
   - PeopleServiceIntegrationTestBase for common test functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Service Tests**
   - Implement integration tests for other Planning Center services as they are added to the client library
   - Consider testing service-specific features and edge cases

2. **Authentication Tests**
   - Test both Personal Access Token and OAuth authentication methods
   - Test token refresh and expiration scenarios

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Test large data set handling
   - Test pagination performance
   - Test concurrent request handling

4. **Error Recovery Tests**
   - Test retry logic for transient errors
   - Test timeout handling
   - Test network interruption scenarios

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Configure integration tests to run in CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up secure credential management for CI/CD

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Test Data Management**
   - Always clean up test data after tests
   - Use inactive status for test records
   - Use random data to avoid conflicts

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Keep sensitive credentials out of source control
   - Document configuration requirements

3. **Test Organization**
   - Group tests by service and functionality
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

4. **Assertions**
   - Use FluentAssertions for readable assertions
   - Assert both positive and negative cases
   - Verify all relevant properties and behaviors
