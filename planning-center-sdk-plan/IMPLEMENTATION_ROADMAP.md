### Quality Targets
- **Test Coverage:** 90%+ for all modules
- **API Coverage:** 100% of documented endpoints
- **Performance:** <200ms average response time
- **Documentation:** 100% public API documented

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Review Architecture
Start with understanding the core architecture:
- Read `architecture/CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Understand `architecture/UNIFIED_MODELS.md`
- Review `architecture/GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_HANDLING.md`
- Study `architecture/LOGGING_STRATEGY.md`
- Review `architecture/CANCELLATION_TOKEN_STRATEGY.md`

### 2. Choose Your Module
Pick a module to implement based on priority:
- **High Priority:** People, Giving, Calendar
- **Medium Priority:** Check-Ins, Groups, Registrations
- **Lower Priority:** Publishing, Services, Webhooks

### 3. Follow Implementation Guide
Use the detailed phase documentation:
- `implementation/DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md`
- Module-specific guides in `modules/`

### 4. Use Examples and Testing
Reference comprehensive examples:
- `examples/USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`
- `testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
