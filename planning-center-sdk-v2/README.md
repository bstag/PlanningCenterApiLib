  - `CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Overall system architecture
  - `UNIFIED_MODELS.md` - Data model strategy
  - `PAGINATION_STRATEGY.md` - Built-in pagination support and helpers
  - `GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_HANDLING.md` - Comprehensive error handling
  - `LOGGING_STRATEGY.md` - Logging and observability strategy
  - `CANCELLATION_TOKEN_STRATEGY.md` - Cancellation and timeout handling
- **`modules/`** - Detailed specifications for all 9 API modules
- **`implementation/`** - Development phases, project structure, and implementation guides
- **`api-reference/`** - Consolidated API documentation and object models
- **`examples/`** - Usage examples and code samples
- **`testing/`** - Testing strategies and quality assurance plans

## 🎯 Key Improvements Over Previous Plans

### Complete Module Coverage

- Strong typing and IntelliSense support
- Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Review Architecture:** Start with `architecture/CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. **Understand Modules:** Explore `modules/` for specific API capabilities
3. **Implementation Plan:** Follow `implementation/DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md`
4. **API Reference:** Use `api-reference/` for detailed object specifications

## 📊 Project Scope

- **Target Framework:** .NET 9
- **Estimated Timeline:** 19-27 weeks
- **Test Coverage Target:** 90%+
- **API Coverage:** 100% of documented endpoints
- **Modules:** All 9 Planning Center API modules
