## How This Was Used

The comprehensive Planning Center SDK v2 plan was created by:

1. **Analyzing** all existing documentation and knowledge
2. **Identifying** gaps and missing features
3. **Consolidating** information into a unified plan
4. **Enhancing** the scope to cover all 9 modules completely
5. **Adding** advanced features like webhooks, caching, and bulk operations

## Key Improvements Made

### Missing Modules Added
- **Publishing Module** - Episodes, Series, Speakers, Media
- **Services Module** - Service plans, Songs, Arrangements, Teams
- **Webhooks Module** - Subscription management, event handling

### Advanced Features Added
- Multi-level caching strategies
- Webhook infrastructure with signature verification
- Bulk operations and batch processing
- Real-time synchronization capabilities
- Advanced relationship navigation
- Performance monitoring and diagnostics

### Enhanced Architecture
- Unified core models across all modules
- Comprehensive error handling and resilience
- Production-ready reliability features
- Enhanced developer experience with fluent API

## Migration to New Plan

The new comprehensive plan is located in `planning-center-sdk-v2/` and includes:
- Complete architectural documentation
- All 9 module specifications
- Detailed implementation phases
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Usage examples and best practices

This archive preserves the original work while the new plan provides the definitive roadmap for the Planning Center .NET SDK development.
