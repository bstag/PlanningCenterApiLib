## Advanced Infrastructure Enhancements

### 1. Authentication Enhancements
```csharp
// Original
public interface IAuthenticator
{
    Task<string> GetAccessTokenAsync();
}

// Enhanced
public interface IAuthenticator
{
    Task<string> GetAccessTokenAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task RefreshTokenAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<bool> ValidateTokenAsync(string token, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    event EventHandler<TokenRefreshedEventArgs> TokenRefreshed;
}
```

### 2. Caching Infrastructure (New)
```csharp
public interface ICacheProvider
{
    Task<T> GetAsync<T>(string key, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task SetAsync<T>(string key, T value, TimeSpan expiry, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task RemoveAsync(string key, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task RemoveByPatternAsync(string pattern, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

### 3. Webhook Infrastructure (New)
```csharp
public interface IWebhookValidator
{
    bool ValidateSignature(string payload, string signature, string secret);
    T DeserializeEvent<T>(string payload) where T : class;
}
```

  - Advanced infrastructure features
  - Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Risk Mitigation Enhancements

### Additional Risks Identified
1. **Increased Scope:** Mitigated by phase-based approach with clear deliverables
2. **Complex Webhook Implementation:** Mitigated by dedicated phase and extensive testing
3. **Performance Requirements:** Mitigated by early performance testing and optimization

## Conclusion

The comprehensive plan addresses significant gaps in the original planning documents by:

1. **Adding 3 Complete Modules:** Publishing, Services, and Webhooks
2. **Enhancing Infrastructure:** Advanced caching, authentication, and webhook support
3. **Improving Developer Experience:** More comprehensive fluent API and better error handling
4. **Ensuring Production Readiness:** Performance optimization, monitoring, and reliability features
5. **Providing Complete Coverage:** All 150+ object models and 9 API modules

This enhanced plan transforms the SDK from a basic API wrapper into a comprehensive, production-ready library that fully leverages the Planning Center API's capabilities.
